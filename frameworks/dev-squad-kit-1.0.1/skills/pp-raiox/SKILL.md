# pp-raiox - x-ray with evidence

## Goal

Produce a traceable technical reading of a delimited target. Unlike `pp-discovery`, this skill goes into the content of the selected files and records findings with path, line and impact.

Use it after a discovery, or when the user has already provided a scope small enough for a deep read.

## When NOT to Activate

- The target is still too broad for a complete read; use `pp-discovery`.
- The job is to merge reports/agents that have already run; use `pp-consolidate`.
- The question requires current external research; use a research flow with sources.
- The user asked for an immediate implementation/fix; use the appropriate feature/dev skill.

## Process

1. Fix the scope and the completeness criterion.
2. Capture the state:
   - `git status --short --branch`
   - the exact list of files in the target.
3. Read the files in dependency order: manifests/configs, entrypoints, core libs, tests/docs.
4. For each finding, record:
   - file and line;
   - observed fact;
   - impact;
   - uncertainty or pending check.
5. Separate fact from recommendation.

## Expected Output

```md
# PP X-Ray - <target>

## Scope
- included:
- excluded:

## Files Read
| file | lines | role |

## Findings
| severity | file:line | fact | impact |

## Flows
1. input -> processing -> output

## Gaps
| gap | why it blocks certainty | how to verify |

## Recommendations
| priority | action | reason |
```

## Guardrails

- Do not claim "the whole repo" if the scope read was partial.
- Do not edit files during the x-ray, unless explicitly requested.
- Do not replace a live audit with old docs.
- If the target is too large, go back to `pp-discovery` and propose waves.

## Contract

**INPUT:** a delimited target and a completeness criterion.

**OUTPUT:** findings with severity, file:line, fact, impact and gaps.

**EXIT CODES:**

| Exit | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | reading complete within the declared scope |
| 1 | warning: gap declared without invalidating the findings |
| 2 | block: scope too broad or evidence missing |
| 3 | error reading the target |

**STATE IT TOUCHES:**

| Path | Action |
|---|---|
| delimited target | read |
| destination chosen by the operator | write the report |

## Executed examples

```console
$ python -c "print('files_read=4')"
files_read=4
```
<!-- executed: 2026-09-22 · exit=0 -->

```console
$ python -c "print('findings=2 gaps=1')"
findings=2 gaps=1
```
<!-- executed: 2026-09-22 · exit=0 -->

```console
$ python -c "import sys; print('block: missing evidence'); sys.exit(2)"
block: missing evidence
```
<!-- executed: 2026-09-22 · exit=2 -->

## Proof

```bash
python -c "print('files_read=4')"
```
